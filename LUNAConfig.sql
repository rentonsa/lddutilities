New College, housing the University&#39;s Faculty of Divinity and the Church of Scotland&#39;s General Assembly Hall (the latter being the temporary home of the Scottish Parliament from 1999) is a jagged-lined rendering of the Gothic style. He also built country houses and mansions in the Italianate and Tudor styles.</p><p>Anderson had four years of legal training, and then while serving with the Royal Engineers he studied construction and design. He then entered the Architectural Section of the School of the Board of Manufactures, and before setting up in practice in Edinburgh, in around 1875, he spent a year in continental travel. His practice was very successful and his output was large. His work included the University of Edinburgh Medical School, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (and Museum of Antiquities), Edinburgh, the Montrose Memorial within the High Kirk of St. Giles, Edinburgh, Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute and Central Station Hotel, Glasgow. Anderson was knighted in 1902 and he was the first President of the Scottish Institute of Architects.</p><p>If you would like to re-use any of these images, please contact the Centre for Research Collections (is-crc@ed.ac.uk) where staff can advise you of the copyright status.

 <div id="inner"><p>The University holds around 2,500 works of art. The Art Collection is now an amalgamation of the University of Edinburgh&#39;s original art collection, which spans some 400 years of collecting, and the Edinburgh College of Art collection of prints, drawings, paintings and sculpture. The ECA collection tells a unique story of the artistic output of the College, particularly in the early to mid-20th century. Some of the most respected names in Scottish art appear, such as S.J. Peploe, John Bellany, Anne Redpath and Elizabeth Blackadder.<p>

<p>The Art Collection has as its centrepiece the Torrie Collection of 17th century Dutch and Italian Masters with works by Ruisdael, ten Oever, Van der Meulen, Pynacker, Rosa and van de Velde. The University also holds the second largest collection of portraits in Scotland ranging from 17th century portraits of John Napier and John Knox to the recent dynamic painting of Peter Higgs by Ken Currie. Other portrait artists represented are Sir Henry Raeburn, Stanley Cursiter, Sir George Reid, James Cowie and Victoria Crowe.</p>

<p>A large percentage of the Art Collection is on display enhancing the public, staff and student spaces of the University. A number of works from the Torrie Collection are on long-term loan to the National Galleries of Scotland. The principal areas of display include Edinburgh College of Art, Old College, Playfair Library, Raeburn Room, the University of Edinburgh Library, New College, McEwan Hall and the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.</p>

<p>As well as supporting research at all levels of the University, the uniqueness of the Art Collection lies in its innovative use. The collection is interpreted and displayed in new and exciting ways, introducing contemporary insights and conversations to constantly reinvigorate debate. This involves working closely with Edinburgh College of Art and The Talbot Rice Gallery to ensure that collections are developed through contemporary collecting and also utilised by some of the world&#39;s leading contemporary artists, academics and curators and presented to as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<div id="inner"><p>Geo science was first taught in Edinburgh under the title of Natural History. Professors included Robert Ramsay, John Walker (1731-1803) and Robert Jameson (1774-1854), who held the Chair for fifty years. When George Allman (1812-1898) was about to retire, the University received a letter from Sir Roderick Impey Murchison (1792-1871), Director of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom, proposing that the Chair of Natural History to be divided, in order to create a separate Chair of Geology. To this end he offered to provide an endowment of &#163;6,000.</p>
<p>The University received a further letter from Murchison, in which he added that the endowment was conditional on him being the person to nominate the new Chair of Geology. The University then wrote to the Treasury asking for a grant of &#163;200 per annum to make the Chair viable. The Treasury replied that they were prepared to provide this sum on condition that Murchison&#39;s clause regarding nomination be deleted.</p>
<p>In March 1871, Archibald Geikie presented his commission to the Senatus Academicus, as the holder of the first Regius Chair of Geology. At that time Archibald Geikie was the President of the Edinburgh Geological Society and, coincidentally, Sir Roderick Murchison was its patron. One way or another, Murchison got his own way. Geikie was succeeded by his younger brother James Geikie (1839-1915) in 1882.</p>
<p>The Geology Department was located in Old College until 1932, when it moved to King&#39;s Buildings. Its new home was named The Grant Institute, in recognition of an endowment from Sir Alexander Grant and was opened by Prime Minister James Ramsay Macdonald on 28 January, 1932.</p>

<div id="inner"><p>John Stuart Blackie (1809-1895) was Professor of Greek at the University of Edinburgh from 1852 to 1882.  He was a man of wide interests and enthusiasms, one of which was for the language and culture of Greece in his own time.
 He promoted the study of ancient Greek through the modern language, and took a lively interest in contemporary Greek nationalism and the debates over the written form of the language.</p>

<p>The collection consists of his books on modern Greece, bequeathed to the University after his death.  There are nearly 500 separate items in the collection, including works of literature, grammar and language, politics and current affairs, folklore,
 some Classical Greek.  Most are in Greek, but some are about Greece in other European languages.  Some include inscriptions and correspondence from their authors, or marginal notes by Blackie.</p>

<div id="inner"><p>In the mid-1840s, the Scottish painter-photographer team of Hill and Adamson produced the first substantial body of self-consciously artistic work using the newly invented medium of photography, one which ranks among the highest achievements of photographic portraiture. A substantial quantity of their work is held by the University Library.  During their four year collaboration, which only ended with the death of Adamson, they produced around 3,000 images, around 700 of which are available in this collection. It includes photographs of local characters and famous figures of the era, as well as landscape and urban scenes.</p>

        <div id="inner"><p>Incunabula, from the Latin for "swaddling clothes", are books from the infancy of printing - anything printed using moveable type before 1501.  These books are among the most precious items in any library and Edinburgh University is privileged to have a significant collection of nearly 300 such books.</p>

        <p>These early books have been extracted from other sequences and other collections, including the libraries of Dugald Stewart and Clement Litill.  Many have numerous provenances.  There are some particularly beautiful books with hand-colouring and early bindings.  A copy of the Decretals of Gratian, printed in 1472, was reputedly the favourite printed book of its owner, William Morris (Inc.4.4).  Most of the books are continental imprints, including a copy of the first book printed at Venice in 1469.  There are, however, two papal indulgences printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1497 and 1498, and an imperfect copy of Caxton''s Polychronicon.</p>

        <p>The oldest printed book in the Library is in fact a Chinese book printed in woodblock in 1440 - Zhou yi zhuan yi da quan [Complete commentaries on the Yi Jing], Df.7.106.</p>

        <div id="inner"><p>St Cecilia&#39;s Hall is home to the University of Edinburgh&#39;s musical instrument collection, which ranks among the world&#39;s most important collections of musical heritage. St Cecilia&#39;s Hall has been granted official Recognised Collection of National Significance to Scotland status.</p>
<p>The emphasis of the Collection is on instruments that are no longer in regular current use and the collecting policy is to acquire instruments when they fall out of use rather than to collect instruments by contemporary makers. The Collection thus covers the period from the 16th century (the earliest from which examples are available for acquisition) to the 20th century (the most recent from which instruments can be regarded as historic).</p>

<p>Many of the instruments are still playable and through an established concert programme and as a regular venue during the Edinburgh International Festival, the Concert Room provides a contemporaneous setting for performances, within which the audience can be seen as the interface between the University and the public. For instance, St Cecilia&#39;s Hall is the only place in the world where it is possible to hear 18th century music in an 18th century concert hall played on 18th century instruments.</p>

<p>The instruments are supplemented by an archive of original materials, working papers and a sound archive. The Collection as a whole attracts researchers from far and wide and is an extensively cited resource in international scholarship. Instruments are lent to prestigious exhibitions at home and internationally.</p>

    <div id="inner"><p>New College Library began in 1843, with the formation of the Free Church of Scotland&#39;s New College. The original Library was founded upon donations, including many rare books from libraries, churches and individuals across Europe. The Library also grew by amalgamation, incorporating, for example, the Library of the United Presbyterian Church in 1900 and the Library of the Church of Scotland&#39;s General Assembly in 1958.</p>

<p>New College Library&#39;s  substantial rare book collections reflect its heritage as a centre of learning for Presbyterian ministry. Early Bibles in Latin, Greek and Hebrew as well as English form a rich seam throughout the collections, which also includes more modern Bibles in languages from throughout the globe. Pamphlets are a particular strength of the collection, including many unique early Scottish imprints. Publications from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries bear witness to the development of religious life and culture in Scotland and the Scottish diaspora, and to the impact of missionary work worldwide.

        <b>Object Lessons</b></a> was an exhibition that ran in the summer of 2003 and which displayed a selection from the University&#39;s large collections. The theme of Object Lessons was not just the history of collecting but also the way in which the whole approach to learning in many key areas in the history of Western thought has been shaped by the same processes of visual analysis and enquiry that have produced these collections. The exhibition also told part of the story of the University itself, for it is especially in these areas of thought that it has played, and continues to play, a distinguished part. Visual skills have been central to this story, where art and science have often worked much more closely together than we might imagine. The themes into which the exhibition was divided have been chosen to illustrate how these continuities of thought link the past with the present and future.</p>

        <div id="inner"><p>The history of the firm of Christian Salvesen goes back to 1851 when Christian Salvesen arrived in Leith and set up in business as a shipowner and broker. Two years later he joined the Edinburgh merchant George Vair Turnbull, continuing in partnership with him until he went solo in 1872.
        Three of his sons, Thomas, Frederick and Theodor joined him in the business; the fourth, Edward, preferred a legal career which began with a law degree from the University of Edinburgh, and which culminated in his elevation to the College of Justice and the Bench as The Hon. Lord Salvesen (1857-1942). </p>
        <p>The archives of Christian Salvesen Ltd were surveyed by the National Register of Archives (Scotland) 1968 and deposited with the University Library in 1969, with several tranches of additional material coming in later years. "A List of the Archives of Messrs Christian Salvesen Limited deposited in Edinburgh University Library" was compiled by Tom Hubbard on a grant from the firm, and was published by the Library in 1981; copies are available for consultation in the Special Collections Department. Histories of the firm held in the Library include "Salvesen of Leith", by Wray Vamplew (Edinburgh & London: Scottish Academic Press, 1975) and "A whaling enterprise: Salvesen in the Antarctic", by Sir Gerald Elliot (Wilby, Norwich [U.K.]: Michael Russell, 1998), both of which have been presented to the Library. Sir Gerald Elliot, Chairman of Christian Salvesen plc from 1981 to 1988, has also presented to the Library a collection of historic books on whaling in the South Atlantic and the Antarctic. </p>

SESSIOn

The case papers of the Scottish Court of Session, Scotland’s supreme civil court, are the most significant, yet still unstudied, printed source for the history, society and literature of Scotland from 1710-1850. During this period, every paper which came before the Court was required to be printed for the lawyers, in a small number of copies.  There are three surviving collections of the Session Papers, held by Edinburgh University Library, the Faculty of Advocates, and the Signet Library, all in the city of Edinburgh and containing approximately 250,000 items.
From October 2016 to April 2017 – and in partnership with the Faculty of Advocates and the Signet Library – the University led a pilot project which captured 13,500 images from the three collections, tackling examples of volumes from different series, dates and physical states, and surveyed the overall conservation and preservation needs.
Further digitisation will be carried out later in 2018 and more images will then be made available.

        <p>Sir John William Thomson-Walker (1871-1937), surgeon and print-collector, formed an outstanding collection of engraved portraits of European medical men dating from the 16th to the 20th centuries.</p>
        <p>Born in Newport, Fife, Thomson-Walker was educated at the Edinburgh Institution and the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1894, before undertaking postgraduate study in Vienna. He set up in Harley Street, London, as a consultant at King&#39;s College and St Peter&#39;s Hospitals, becoming one of the leading urologists of his day. In 1907 he was appointed a Hunterian Professor of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and was knighted in 1922. He held a number of visiting lectureships, and was elected President of the Medical Society of London in 1933. </p>
        <p>Print collecting was his lifelong passion. In his will, Thomson-Walker bequeathed his collection to the University of Edinburgh, "in the hope of encouraging the study of the history of medicine on which this great medical school has had such a profound and lasting influence". The collection came to the University in 1939. Including subsequent accessions funded by his endowment, it now totals nearly 3,000 prints and a number of books on the art and technique of engraving. Digitisation of the prints is ongoing. </p>

The former include portraits of Scott and of people associated with Scott, art inspired by his novels and poems, illustrations to editions of his works, and pictures of places associated with Scott. They cover a variety of formats: oil and watercolour paintings, drawings, engravings, etchings, lithographs, and photographs. The realia consist of memorabilia and other examples of material culture associated with Scott and his homes and haunts (especially Abbotsford). In addition, there are playbills, title pages, and illustrative material relating to theatrical and musical adaptations of Scott and to translations of his work. The Image Collection also contains manuscripts of Scott&#39;s works and correspondence drawn from the Corson Collection and the Library&#39;s Laing Collection. </p><p>Like the Corson Collection itself, the Image Database is wide-ranging and eclectic. It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the diffusion of Scott&#39;s work in Scotland, Great Britain, and abroad, in Scott&#39;s role in the creation of Scottish national identity, and in his influence on British and foreign depictions of Scotland.</p><p>For more information on Scott&#39;s life and work, visit Edinburgh University Library&#39;s <a href = "http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk">Walter Scott Digital Archive</a>.</p><p>Have a look at our <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/crcedinburgh/sets/72157645197625560/map/">Flickr map</a>, which shows the locations of some of the engravings in modern-day Edinburgh!</p><p align=left><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Info<p align=left><img src="https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/graphics/by-front.jpg"/></a><p><a href = "http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/crc/services/copying-and-digitisation/permission-to-reproduce-images/takedown-policy" target="_blank">Our Takedown Policy</a></p></div></font>'
