The epic is presumably based on the life of a 3rd century Scottish king, Fingal, by his son Ossian. MacPherson studied for one year at the Univeristy of Edinburgh with the intend of joining the clergy however, he withdrew from studies to persue literature. The Ossian Poems were instantly popular given the atmosphere of Scottish nationalism and remained popular texts throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. During his life there was much controversy surrounding the origins of Fingal and posthumously Fingal was proven to be MacPherson's creation.
