The paper on the left is the first page of a 1787 manuscript copy of \u201cAddress to Edinburgh\u201d, which has been digitised individually. Dated from 23 Oct 1791, the paper on the left is addressed to the Lady and introduces a poem that Burns wrote in memory of James Cunningham, the Earl of Glencairn, who was both an important patron of Burns\u2019 and the Lady\u2019s brother. Archived along with this letter is an undigitised manuscript copy of this poem, titled \u201cLament for James Earl of Glencairn\u201d. The paper in the centre was sent to the Lady in 1789 and recounts a \u201cnew piece of Pslamody said to be composed for, & sung on the late joyful solemnity \u2013 the twenty third of April last, in a certain chapel of cafe, somewhere in the meridian of Kalmarnock\u201d. The poem reads as follows: |O sing a new song to the Lord, Make all & every one, A joyful noise even for the king, His restoration. The sons of Belial in the land Did set their heads together, Come let us sweep them off, said they, Like an o\u2019erflowing river. |They set their heads together, I say, They set their heads together; On right, & left, & ev\u2019ry hand We saw none to deliver. Thou madest strong two chosen ones To quell the wicked\u2019s pride; That young man great in Issachar, The burden-bearing tribe. |And him among the princes chief In our Jerusalem, The Judge that\u2019s might in the law, The man that fears thy name \u2013 Yet they, even they, with all their strength, Began to faint + fail, Even as two howling, rav\u2019ning wolves To dogs do turn their tail. |Th\u2019 ungodly o\u2019er the just prevail\u2019d For so though had\u2019st appointed, That thou might\u2019st greater glory give Unto thine own Annointed. And now thou hast restor\u2019d our State, Pity our Kirk also, For she by tribulations Is now brought very low. |Consume that High place, Patronage, From off thy holy hill; And in thy fury burn the book Even of that man Mcgill. Now hear our pray\u2019r, accept our song, And fight thy chosen\u2019s battle: We seek but little, Lord, from thee, Thou kens we get as little.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Paper</span>", "label": "Material"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Scotland</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Burns, Robert</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Lady Henrietta Don</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Manuscripts</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>Various</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Subset/Host Work</span>", "label": "Related Work Notes"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Burns, Robert</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Eighteenth Century</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Lady Henrietta Don</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>38659998</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Manuscripts, Various</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2010:03:25 10:40:28</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 7390, "width": 6000, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~2~2~43388~102265/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~2~2~43388~102265"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 7390, "width": 6000, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~2~2~43388~102265/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Address to Edinburgh, f.22, p.1", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~2~2~43388~102265/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm-2-NA/1010/0007542c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0007542</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>La.III.586</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>Address to Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.22, p.1</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Burns, Robert</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Author</span>", "label": "Creator Role"}, {"value": "<span>1787</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The recto side of a manuscript copy of \u201cAddress to Edinburgh\u201d in Burns\u2019 hand.

Burns\u2019s letter graciously thanks the Earl, but declines the invitation, voicing the figure of Wisdom to do so. Wisdom reminds Burns that he had to leave Scotland to make his living, and that he might too soon find himself destitute again. He therefore states: \u201cI must return to my humble station, and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way at the Plough-tail\u201d.
