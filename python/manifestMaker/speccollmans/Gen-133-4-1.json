A fellow of the Royal Society, he carried out experimental work on the embryonic development of the horse and conducted numerous experiments on his estate - the so called Penicuick Experiments - on the hybridisation of zebras and horses. He was a pioneer in domestic animal improvement by selective breeding and in the study of animal reproduction. It was largely due to his presence in Edinburgh that the University was chosen as the site for an institute of Animal Genetics, one of the first such in the world. This decision was later to have a major impact on the development of Edinburgh as a major centre of biological research and teaching. His investigations into experimental breeding started around 1894, before the rediscovery of Johann Gregor Mendel's (1822-1884) laws of heredity.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Zebroid, Cross between Horse and Zebra, James Cossar Ewart</span>", "label": "Subject"}, {"value": "<span>c.1900</span>", "label": "Subject Date"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Departments</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Departments</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>University Of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Saddle</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>85413236</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Horse and Zebra Cross, Recto</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2005:12:02 11:37:51</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/Gen-133-4-1.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "Gen-133-4-1"}
