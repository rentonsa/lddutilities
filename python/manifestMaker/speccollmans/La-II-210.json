Burn's seal, cut into glass and hung on a silver chain, is held at the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Seal</span>", "label": "Subject"}, {"value": "<span>Burns, Robert</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Eigteenth Century</span>", "label": "Subject Period"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Charter and Seal</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.1</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Subset/Host Work</span>", "label": "Related Work Notes"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Robert Burns</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Seal</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>125549420</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Seal, f.1</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2010:02:17 14:25:14</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 7050, "width": 4580, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~2~2~51084~103200/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~2~2~51084~103200"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 7050, "width": 4580, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~2~2~51084~103200/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Collections of Poems and Letters, f.22r", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~2~2~51084~103200/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm-2-NA/1010/0024679c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0024679</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>La.II.210</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>Collections of Poems and Letters</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.22r</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Burns, Robert</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Author</span>", "label": "Creator Role"}, {"value": "<span>Lyle, James</span>", "label": "Associate Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Lyle, James</span>", "label": "Associate Creator Name"}, {"value": "<span>Author</span>", "label": "Associate Creator Role"}, {"value": "<span>Murray, Catherine Isabella</span>", "label": "Associate Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Murray, Catherine Isabella</span>", "label": "Associate Creator Name"}, {"value": "<span>Author</span>", "label": "Associate Creator Role"}, {"value": "<span>A page from a larger scrapbook-like collection of poems, letters and other ephemera. This particular page focuses on an Excise Paper written by Robert Burns in 1794. The Paper is included on the page. Written in Burns\u2019 hand, it reads \u201cMalt 87th year, 1794. Dumfries Colln. Do. District. Do. 1st Division. 8th Round Voucher. Including 13th May and 24th June. Q.n.ty. 240 Q.l.ty. Best Floor \u00a3 S.D. 660\u201d. The Paper is signed by John Mitchell, Alexander Findlater, and Robert Burns. Undigitised are the verso of this page, containing a full breakdown of Burns\u2019 bill, and a second page, which states \u201cAmount of this Voucher is two hundred & forty bushels from Best \u2013 Cash is six pounds, six shillings\u201d. Several other pieces of information have been appended to the Paper over time. On 24th February 1885, Catherine Murray wrote a letter to Mr. James Lyle on the Paper to the left of Burn\u2019s writing. Her letter reads \u201cThis document, with a few others of a similar description, was rescued \u2018on their way to the Snuff Shop\u2019 (about 80 years ago) by my Father the late David Murray, C. A. Edinburgh, who was Deputy Comptroller of Excise, for Scotland. Three of these he sent to the Collection of \u2018Relics\u2019 in Burns\u2019 Monument Edin. As \u2018illustrative, so far as they go, of poor Burns\u2019 duties as an office of Excise\u2019. With Mr. Findlater, who was a staunch friend of the Poet\u2019s, my Father was well acquainted + had much official intercourse with him. Mr. Mitchell is the person to whom Burns addresses his lines for the loan of a guinea.\u201d Underneath this letter, Lyle has added a signed note stating \u201cMiss Murray gave me this document at this date\u201d. To the right of Burn\u2019s writing on the Paper, Lyle has added several other pieces of information. He pencilled in a note praising Mr. Findlater as a \u201cmost intelligent + respectable man\u201d and referencing correspondence that exists between Burns and Findlater. (An example of such a letter and more information on Findlater can be found through the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum here http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/collections/object_detail/3.6061.) Lyle has also pasted onto the Paper a newspaper clipping of Catherine Murray\u2019s obituary in 1908, which discusses both her and her late father, both of whom are buried at Greyfriar's Kirkyard, Edinburgh. Underneath the clipping, Lyle has added a signed note stating \u201cI knew Mr. Murray very well\u201d. Below this obituary, a newspaper clipping titled \u201cRelic of Burns: Interesting Document in Edinburgh University\u201d has been pasted in. The article details Lyle\u2019s donation of the Burns Excise Paper to the Edinburgh University Library. The article contains quotations from Catherine\u2019s letter, many of which it can be seen have been underlined in the letter itself. According to a handwritten annotation at the bottom of the clipping, the article is from \"Dispatch 2 Nov 1910\".</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Mixed Paper Sources</span>", "label": "Material"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Burns, Robert</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Excise Paper</span>", "label": "Subject Object"}, {"value": "<span>1794</span>", "label": "Subject Date"}, {"value": "<span>Findlater, Alexander</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Murray, Catherine Isabella</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Authors</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Murray, David</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Lyle, James</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Collections of Poems and Letters</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.22r</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Subset/Host Work</span>", "label": "Related Work Notes"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Authors</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Correspondence and Journals</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Excise Paper</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Eighteenth Century</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>96911956</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Collections of Poems and Letters, f.22r</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2012:05:08 10:27:55</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/La-II-210.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "La-II-210"}
