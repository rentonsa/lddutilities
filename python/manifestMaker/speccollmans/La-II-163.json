Adam Ferguson, previously working as a professor at the University of Edinburgh, became heavily involved in the American War of Independence, especially when asked to join the Carlisle commission which went to America in order to negotiate an agreement with Washington and the American congress. Once in America, Ferguson was appointed secretary of the commission. As this letter states, Ferguson was denied a passport and Washington was wary to make any decisions without the consent of congress beforehand. Ultimately, congress continued to ignore or deny requests from the commission until the party finally returned to Britain later that year. The letter is signed June 9: 1778, three days after the commission arrived in America.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>History</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>USA</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Letter from George Washington to Dr Ferguson</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>Unpaginated</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Washington</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Letter</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Correspondence and Journals</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>War of Independence</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Ferguson</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Clinton</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Letter from George Washington to Dr Ferguson, Unpaginated</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/La-II-163.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "La-II-163"}
