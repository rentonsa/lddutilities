This edition was printed and sold in Niddery's Wynd (Edinburgh). The title page contains a spelling error: six is printed as \"sis\". The sixth edition contains \"Added Witty and Entertaining Jests, &c\" not included in earlier editions. The page displays a woodcut image of a man. Above the printer's information at the bottom of the page, \"[Edinburgh]\" as the place of publication has been written in ink by hand. The currently undigitised artefact that this page comes from is an interesting volume. Interleaved with the 1781 pages are manuscript pages and illustrations from c. 1822. Numbers referencing annotations and notes have been written into the original pages, including numbers for notes which the new editor never completed. This hybrid edition/manuscript contains a handwritten page that states: \u201c\u2019One Hundred Years hence\u2019 to be published, by the then Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, - a new and improved edition, of The Witty Exploits of George Buchanan; with suitable illustrations from the most famous pews of this critical and imaginative Age; and adorned with elegant engravings from original drawings by distinguished Artists. The mentioned illustrations are by Alexander Corse and Alexander Christie and are distributed throughout the volume. No full name is given of the new editor, but the secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland from 1819-1822 was John Dillon, so it is possible that he is the editor. David Laing was also a long-standing member of this Society, possibly indicating where he came to acquire this book.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh, Scotland</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Wit and Jests</span>", "label": "Subject"}, {"value": "<span>Buchanan, George</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Titlepage</span>", "label": "Subject Object"}, {"value": "<span>Religion</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Carse, Alexander</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Christianity</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Christie, Alexander</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>The witty and entertaining exploits of George Buchanan</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>Title page</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Titlepage</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Woodcut Image</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Eighteenth Century</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Buchanan, George</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>The witty and entertaining exploits of George Buchanan, Title page</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/La-III-605.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "La-III-605"}
