The prophet stands in the centre of the picture. In front of him is a rock, from which the camel emerges. Behind him is another rock, with butts of trees growing from it and a group of six figures of the people Thamud, who register amazement at the event, in front of it. Three of them squat on the ground, a gold wine vessel and a silver bowl on a pedestal in front of them; two more stand behind, the left-hand one pointing at the prophet, the one on the right holding a glass. The face of the furthest right figure is cut across by the margin. All, being Arabs, wear turbans, except the man with the glass, who has a Mongol cap with a fur brim (type D). The prophet has a sort of veil over his turban, which hangs to the ground on his right side; apart from this, all wear the usual loose garments with left-over-right fold in front. The faces are more Persian than Mongol. The ground is on several planes, and the whole scene is conceived in considerable depth. The colouring is mainly ochre, pale red and blue, with oxidised silver here and there. The page is severely damaged in places. The camel is drawn in fine calligraphic line while the rocks have strong outlines, both of Chinese origin. The style is rather less Oriental than that of [f.1r], but the work is nevertheless to be attributed to the same painter, the lram Master.Detail of miniature from the Compendium of Chronicles by Rashid al-Din.

Sebuktegin is most likely to be represented by the figure on the left, which is striking the opposing leader's head with a blow from his mace. Arguably the greatest treasure in the library, the Jami' al-Tawarikh, or Compendium of Chronicles, is a world history which encompasses a range of cultures, from China in the East, to Ireland in the West, from the time of Adam. It is written in the Naskh script and contains 70 illustrated folios.
