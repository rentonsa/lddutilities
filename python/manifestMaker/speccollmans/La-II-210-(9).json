Of \u201cWaukin o\u2019 the Fauld\u201d , Burns says that there are \u201ctwo stanzas still sung to this tune\u201d and he believes this song to be the original that inspired Ramsay\u2019s song of the same name in \u201cGentle Shepherd\u201d. Burns records the first two lines of the song, and then states: \u201cI regret that, as in many of our old songs, the delicacy of this old fragment is not equal to its wit and humor.\u201d Of \u201cMill Mill O\u201d, Burns records a stanza and chorus from what he believes to the original.

Mass. John fell into the hands of some soldiers who suspected that he might be a member of the Clergy.

The soldiers \u201cswore he was a d\u2014d honest fellow & that it was impossible he could belong to these hellish conventicles, & so gave him his liberty\u201d. Burns then explains that the first stanza of the song is a favourite dramatic interlude in south-west country weddings. It describes a \u201cyoung fellow\u201d dressed as an \u201cold beggar\u201d.

Regarding \u201cThe lass of Liviston\u201d, Burns only records four lines, stating that \u201cThe old song, in three eight-line stanzas, is well known, and has merit as to wit and humour; but is rather unfit for insertion\u201d. Regarding \u201cThe lass o\u2019 Patie\u2019s Mill\u201d, Burns records no lines, but states that this song has been variously claimed by Ayrshire and by a Clergyman of Galston. Burns says that his \u201cmuch-esteemed friend Sir William Cunningham of Robertland\u201d was told by the \u201clate John, Earl of Loudon\u201d that Allan Ramsay wrote the song for the then Earl of Loudon at Loudon Castle.

Burns references an alternate title of \u201cThe Blacksmith and his Apron\u201d. For \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d, no lines are recorded, but Burns says that Ramsay took the first line of the song from a fragment that can \u201cbe seen in the _Museum_, vol.

Another four- or five-stanza version, which is said to predate Jacobite times, goes by the title \u201cJinglan Johnie\u201d. A three-stanza version under the title \u201cHighland Laddie\u201d is referenced and said to have been recorded by Ramsay. A \u201cHighland Laddie\u201d is also said to exist that is made up of \u201cthe tune of several Jacobite fragments\u201d.

David Williamson and Lady Cherrytrees\u2019 daughter that occurred when Williamson was hiding from a party of dragoons (see page 11 for more). Burns reports that \u201cA mutilated stanza or two\u201d from \u201cDainty Dave\u201d are recorded in Herd\u2019s Collection, but that the song has \u201cfive or six stanzas\u201d and Burns records the first of these. Burns also believes that the chorus from a song Ramsay records as \u201cLuckie Nansie\u201d was derived from \u201cDainty Dave\u201d. For \u201cTweedside\u201d, Burns states that the original is said to be a two-stanza song \u201ccomposed by a Lord Yester\u201d.
