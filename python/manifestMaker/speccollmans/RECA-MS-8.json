The photographs are captioned, neatly, by hand, on the album leaves. The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863).

Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.12r (b)</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.12r (b)</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 4932, "width": 6880, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61240~166398/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61240~166398"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 4932, "width": 6880, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61240~166398/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.13r", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61240~166398/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066492c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066492</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.13r</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.

The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863). Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.21r</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.21r</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 5062, "width": 6860, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61249~166389/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61249~166389"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 5062, "width": 6860, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61249~166389/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.22r", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61249~166389/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066501c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066501</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.22r</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.

The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863). Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.30r</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.30r</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 5075, "width": 6967, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61258~166380/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61258~166380"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 5075, "width": 6967, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61258~166380/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.31r", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61258~166380/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066510c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066510</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.31r</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.

The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863). Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.39r</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.39r</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 5096, "width": 6970, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61267~166371/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61267~166371"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 5096, "width": 6970, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61267~166371/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.40r", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61267~166371/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066519c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066519</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.40r</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.

The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863). Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.41r, detail</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.41r, detail</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 5140, "width": 6960, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61280~166358/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61280~166358"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 5140, "width": 6960, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61280~166358/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.40r, detail", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61280~166358/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066532c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066532</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.40r, detail</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.

The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863). Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.28r, detail</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.28r, detail</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 5348, "width": 6576, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61293~166345/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61293~166345"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 5348, "width": 6576, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61293~166345/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.27r, detail", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61293~166345/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066545c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066545</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.27r, detail</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.

The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863). Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.15r, detail</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.15r, detail</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 4947, "width": 6948, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61306~166332/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61306~166332"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 4947, "width": 6948, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61306~166332/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.14r, detail", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61306~166332/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066558c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066558</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.14r, detail</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.

The pictures of Lord Elgin\u2019s campaign are accurately dated, August \u2013 October 1860, but of the rest only one is dated (Fol. 10 \u201cConsular Church, Canton\u201d, 1863). Very few are in any way signed: those which are have \u2018S. Dutton\u2019 or \u2018Dutton and Michaels\u2019 written on the negatives, often in such a way that it is not particularly obvious on the print. However, many of the photographs can be attributed from external sources: those of Elgin\u2019s campaign are the work of Felice Beato, who travelled with the army, probably on a semi-official basis, and who was given access to the sites of battles immediately afterwards. Most of the portraits of Chinese people are the work of \u201cMr. M. Miller\u201d, who ran a photographic studio in Hong Kong between 1861 and 1864. He may also be responsible for some of the landscape views, particularly the multi-plate panoramas. However, he was taught this technique by Beato himself, and C. Worswick observes that the two photographers\u2019 images of this type are often indistinguishable. Beato worked with an artist, Charles Wirgman, in Japan between 1864 and 1867, to produce very high quality tinted versions of his prints. On the basis of the presence of a combination of Beato and Miller\u2019s work it can be concluded that the album probably dates from the mid-1860s. Some of the photographs are probably the work of others, notably the image on fols. 1 and 2, of \u201cGovernor Yeh\u201d, who was captured by the British in 1858, and died in captivity in India in 1859, and is thus unlikely to have come into contact with either Beato or Miller. Photographs of this sort were typically bought by members of the army or foreign service, to take or send home as mementos of their service, and seem generally to have been mounted into albums only when they got home. The majority of the albums are much smaller than the Edinburgh College of Art example: the only other album found which is of similar size is held by the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and is believed to be a presentation copy to Lord Elgin, having been sold by his descendants in 1974.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>China</span>", "label": "Subject Place"}, {"value": "<span>Travel</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Military</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.3r, detail</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Out of Copyright.</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped TIFF</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.3r, detail</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Copyright The University of Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full Public Access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}, {"description": "", "height": 4411, "width": 3588, "@type": "sc:Canvas", "images": [{"on": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61319~166319/canvas/c1", "motivation": "sc:painting", "resource": {"service": {"profile": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json", "@context": "http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61319~166319"}, "format": "image/jpeg", "height": 4411, "width": 3588, "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/UoEwmm~3~3~61319~166319/full/!1024,1024/0/default.jpg", "@type": "dctypes:Image"}, "@type": "oa:Annotation"}], "label": "Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d, f.2r, detail", "@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/iiif/m/UoEwmm~3~3~61319~166319/canvas/c1", "thumbnail": {"@id": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/MediaManager/srvr?mediafile=/Size0/UoEwmm~3~3/264/0066571c.jpg"}, "metadata": [{"value": "<span>0066571</span>", "label": "Work Record ID"}, {"value": "<span><a href = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src = \"http://lac-luna-live4.is.ed.ac.uk:8181/graphics/by.jpg\"/></a></span>", "label": "Licence"}, {"value": "<span>RECA.MS.8</span>", "label": "Shelfmark"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Holding Institution"}, {"value": "<span>N/A</span>", "label": "Catalogue Number"}, {"value": "<span>Photograph Album \u201cChina\u201d</span>", "label": "Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.2r, detail</span>", "label": "Subset Index"}, {"value": "<span>Elgin, Lord</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Beato, Felice</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>Miller, M.</span>", "label": "Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1858-1864</span>", "label": "Date"}, {"value": "<span>The album is large, measuring 69 cm, in a fairly elaborate embossed and gilt-tooled leather binding, with \u2018China\u2019 tooled in gilt on the front; it contains 59 mounted images on 56 leaves; at least thirteen leaves are missing.
