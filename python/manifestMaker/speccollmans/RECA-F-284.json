Britton was one of the first to focus on the details of the Roslyn Chapel in published engravings. This view is of the apprentice column, named after the story of an apprentice who completed the column without seeing the original in which he was meant to imitate while his master was away viewing the model. When his came back, the master struck down the apprentice with a mallet in a jealous fit. It was then said that the master's face was carved at the other end of the chapel forever gazing on the apprentice column. This engraving of the apprentice column and those surrounding it was created by J. Burnett from a drawing by Joseph Gandy. Britton then dedicates the page to Sir Walter Scott \"Whose various poetical, & critical writings entice much Genius and Knowledge\".</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Scotland</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Scotland</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>116838924</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>An Essay Towards an History and Description of Roslyn Chapel, Scotland, pl.7</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full public access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/RECA-F-284.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "RECA-F-284"}
