He opened his own practice in the city in 1717, and soon gained a reputation as an expert surgeon. In 1727 the corporation of York appointed him city surgeon. Drake was inspired to begin writing his great work on the history and antiquities of the city of York some time around 1729, and he began to research his project in the ancient deeds and registers of the city. In 1741 he accepted the post of honorary surgeon to the York County Hospital, a position he held until 1756. From this date on, Drake devoted himself to antiquarian and historical study.
