J B Waring, known architect and draftsman, was superintendent of the architectural gallery and of the classes for furniture, earthenware, and glass, goldsmiths' work and jewellery, and objects used in architecture. Out of this, Waring produced a 300 plate book of lithographs of these items found at the exhibition. Each work was created by a different artist but all lithographed through Day & Son, \u2018lithographers to the queen\u2019. Day & Son was originally the partnership of William Day and the Belgium artist and lithographer, Haghe, but later got its name when Haghe was replaced by William Simpson. This work was not printed though in William Day\u2019s lifetime. Rather, it was one of the later works printed by his son who took over the business, shortly before its failing in 1867.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>chromolithography</span>", "label": "Technique"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>London</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>A Cabinet</span>", "label": "Subject"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Art</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Design</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Masterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture at the International Exhibition, Vol.III, 1862</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>pl.295</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Subset/Host Work</span>", "label": "Related Work Notes"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Illustrated titlepages and plates stamped in ink: \"Science & Art Department Deposit Loan\" = loan from South Kensington Museum to the Trustee's Academy, Edinburgh.</span>", "label": "Provenance Notes"}, {"value": "<span>Art</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Design</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>111533008</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Masterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture at the International Exhibition, Vol.III, 1862, pl.295</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Full public access</span>", "label": "Repro Publication Status"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/REAC-FF-541.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "REAC-FF-541"}
