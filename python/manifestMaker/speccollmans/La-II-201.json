The reverend\u2019s name appears in the transcription, but has been subsequently blacked out with ink. The transcription is one of several copies said to exist of this account and Laing notes that the original account is generally thought to be dated around 1741. This proliferation of copies could be due to Lady Grange\u2019s own instructions in the account, which ask that whoever receives the letter \u201cmay cause to write it over in a fair hand & show it to all my friends\u201d. This particular transcription is missing pages 5 and 6 (as noted in Dr. Carlyle\u2019s hand on the bottom of page 4). Included in the Laing collection, however, is an 1850 transcription of the missing pages copied down from a printing of Lady Grange\u2019s account that appeared in \u201cEdinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany, being a New Series of the Scots Magazine for November 1817, Is. 333\u201d. The 1850 transcriber notes that \u201cthe copy printed is not precisely the same as this one, but the differences seem immaterial. They are certainly however not copies of each other. And it is probable that this copy, had been forwarded by Lady Grange\u2019s directions to the Revd William Carlyle Minister of Prestonpans, in which Parish she + her husband had so long resided \u2013 and who was the father of Dr. Carlyle [of Inveresk, d. 1805], in whose repositories this imperfect copy was found.\u201d The paper of the transcription is aged and weakened along the folds.

Differing slightly from the 1738 letter addressed to Lady Grange\u2019s solicitor, this account includes descriptions of her efforts to get letters off the island and names a reverend who tried to help her and who felt under threat for doing so. The reverend\u2019s name appears in the transcription, but has been subsequently blacked out with ink. The transcription is one of several copies said to exist of this account and Laing notes that the original account is generally thought to be dated around 1741. This proliferation of copies could be due to Lady Grange\u2019s own instructions in the account, which ask that whoever receives the letter \u201cmay cause to write it over in a fair hand & show it to all my friends\u201d. This particular transcription is missing pages 5 and 6 (as noted in Dr. Carlyle\u2019s hand on the bottom of page 4). Included in the Laing collection, however, is an 1850 transcription of the missing pages copied down from a printing of Lady Grange\u2019s account that appeared in \u201cEdinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany, being a New Series of the Scots Magazine for November 1817, Is. 333\u201d. The 1850 transcriber notes that \u201cthe copy printed is not precisely the same as this one, but the differences seem immaterial. They are certainly however not copies of each other. And it is probable that this copy, had been forwarded by Lady Grange\u2019s directions to the Revd William Carlyle Minister of Prestonpans, in which Parish she + her husband had so long resided \u2013 and who was the father of Dr. Carlyle [of Inveresk, d. 1805], in whose repositories this imperfect copy was found.\u201d The paper of the transcription is aged and weakened along the folds.

By this time, she had spent nearly nine years on the island in very poor living conditions. Although a rescue attempt was arranged, she was again kidnapped before this help could reach her.

An undated and uncredited handwritten transcription of Lady Grange\u2019s account of her brutal treatment during her kidnapping from Edinburgh and subsequent exile on St Kilda. Rachel Erskine (n\u00e9e Chiesley), Lady Grange, (1679-1745) was forcibly kidnapped and exiled to the isle of St Kilda in 1732. This plot was designed by her husband, James Erskine, Lord Grange, (1679-1754) out of fear that Lady Grange would expose him as a Jacobite. News of her plight began to be known when letters were smuggled off St Kilda in 1738, taking two years to reach Lord Advocate Charles Erskine in Edinburgh in 1740. By this time, she had spent nearly nine years on the island in very poor living conditions. Although a rescue attempt was arranged, she was again kidnapped before this help could reach her. After 1740, she was moved to various locations in the islands, leading to her eventual arrival in Skye in 1742. She died unrescued on Skye in 1745. Differing slightly from the 1738 letter addressed to Lady Grange\u2019s solicitor, this account includes descriptions of her efforts to get letters off the island and names a reverend who tried to help her and who felt under threat for doing so.

The transcription is one of several copies said to exist of this account and Laing notes that the original account is generally thought to be dated around 1741.

Page 9 of 11. Handwritten pages supplementing 2 missing pages from an undated and uncredited handwritten transcription of Lady Grange\u2019s account of her brutal treatment during her kidnapping from Edinburgh and subsequent exile on St Kilda. Rachel Erskine (n\u00e9e Chiesley), Lady Grange, (1679-1745) was forcibly kidnapped and exiled to the isle of St Kilda in 1732. This plot was designed by her husband, James Erskine, Lord Grange, (1679-1754) out of fear that Lady Grange would expose him as a Jacobite. News of her plight began to be known when letters were smuggled off St Kilda in 1738, taking two years to reach Lord Advocate Charles Erskine in Edinburgh in 1740. By this time, she had spent nearly nine years on the island in very poor living conditions. Although a rescue attempt was arranged, she was again kidnapped before this help could reach her. After 1740, she was moved to various locations in the islands, leading to her eventual arrival in Skye in 1742. She died unrescued on Skye in 1745. Differing slightly from the 1738 letter addressed to Lady Grange\u2019s solicitor, this later account includes descriptions of her efforts to get letters off the island and names a reverend who tried to help her and who felt under threat for doing so. The reverend\u2019s name appears in the transcription, but has been subsequently blacked out with ink. The transcription is one of several copies said to exist of this account and Laing notes that the original account is generally thought to be dated around 1741. This proliferation of copies could be due to Lady Grange\u2019s own instructions in the account, which ask that whoever receives the letter \u201cmay cause to write it over in a fair hand & show it to all my friends\u201d. These 2 supplemental pages were transcribed in 1850 and stand in for pages 5 and 6 of the older transcription. The 1850 pages have been copied down from a printing of Lady Grange\u2019s account that appeared in \u201cEdinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany, being a New Series of the Scots Magazine for November 1817, Is. 333\u201d.

Background: Rachel Erskine (n\u00e9e Chiesley), Lady Grange, (1679-1745) was forcibly kidnapped and exiled to the isle of St Kilda in 1732. This plot was designed by her husband, James Erskine, Lord Grange, (1679-1754) out of fear that Lady Grange would expose him as a Jacobite. News of her plight began to be known when letters were smuggled off St Kilda in 1738, taking two years to reach Edinburgh in 1740. By this time, she had spent nearly nine years on the island in very poor living conditions. Although a rescue attempt was arranged, she was again kidnapped before this help could reach her. After 1740, she was moved to various locations in the islands, leading to her eventual arrival in Skye in 1742.
