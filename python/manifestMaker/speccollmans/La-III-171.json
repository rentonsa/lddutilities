One ship is much larger than the other, helping to illustrate the mathematical question at hand. Lines are drawn from the top most point of one ship to the bottom most point of the other, the bottom most point to the parallel point on the other ships base, and finally vertically from this point back to the top most point of the ship. These three lines make up a triangle labelled A,B and C with measurements following the distances between points. Opposite of this image, on the recto, is another drawing of a similar triangle but now drawn between two trees and a tower, creating another point of reference, D. Both the ship and tree scenes are drawn within ovals.
