The letter includes not only the room that he is being held in during his imprisonment, but also that he is being kept in chains. The letter has been addressed to a lady, and was delivered by Brodie's agent Alexander Peterson. Brodie was a burgher and Deacon of the Guild of Wrights, and a well respected man in the community. He used his business as a cabinet maker to case employers houses, make copies of their keys and then burgle homes in order to support his two mistress, five children, and gambling habits. Brodie's final crime was against His Majesty's Excise Office in Chessel's Court, on the Cannon Gate. Despite meticulously planning the burglary himself, Brodie's partner Ainslie was captured and turned evidence against Brodie and their other partner George Smith in order to avoid execution. Brodie escaped to the Netherlands, but was arrested in Amsterdam and returned to Edinburgh for trial and execution. The trial began 27 August 1788 and Brodie was hanged at Tollboth, from a gallows of his own design, 1 October 1788. Brodie is reported to have bribed the hangman to ignore a metal collar that he was wearing to avoid suffocation, and made arrangements to have his body quickly removed for revival. Despite these efforts, Brodie's friends were unable to bring him back to life and he was buried in an unmarked graved at a Buccleuch Parish Church.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh, Scotland</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Deacon William Brodie</span>", "label": "Subject Person"}, {"value": "<span>Scotland</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Letter by Deacon Brodie, Begging for Mercy Shortly Before his Execution</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.4r</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Subset/Host Work</span>", "label": "Related Work Notes"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Scotland</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Deacon Brodie</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Correspondence and Journals</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Eighteenth Century</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>124040218</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Letter by Deacon Brodie, Begging for Mercy Shortly Before his Execution, f.4r</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2012:05:08 10:27:55</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/La-II-131.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "La-II-131"}
