He was elected master of Caius College in 1803, a position which he held until his death. Davy practised medicine with a lot of success. He was made prebendary of Chichester in 1832. This portrait shows Davy in his elaborate congregation robes. It was drawn by Thomas Uwins (1782-1857), a painter in oil and water-colours. From 1798 Uwins became a miniature-portrait painter, and from 1847-1855 he was keeper of the National Gallery, London.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Engraving</span>", "label": "Technique"}, {"value": "<span>Line and stipple; hand-coloured</span>", "label": "Secondary Technique"}, {"value": "<span>University of Edinburgh Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections</span>", "label": "Department"}, {"value": "<span>London</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Davy, Martin (1763-1839)</span>", "label": "Subject"}, {"value": "<span>Sitter</span>", "label": "Subject Role"}, {"value": "<span>Portraits</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Medicine</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>A history of the University of Cambridge (London)</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>Ackermann, R.</span>", "label": "Related Work Creator"}, {"value": "<span>1815</span>", "label": "Related Work Publish Date"}, {"value": "<span>Unverified</span>", "label": "Related Work Desc"}, {"value": "<span>Digital Image: Copyright \u00a9 The University of Edinburgh.
