Although this draft is very similar to the version published, lines 13 and 14 of the draft do not appear in the published version. It also appears from this draft that the poem has been divided into two stanza, whilst the published version contains only one. In the 1773 edition of _The Poetical Works of Robert Fergusson, with biogr intr., notes and glossary by R. Ford_, edited by Robert Ford, the note for this poem reads: \"This was first printed by Dr. Grosart, in 1851, as an additional note to the poem of \"Auld Reekie,\" from the holograph of Fergusson, furnished to him for the purpose by David Laing of the Writers to the Signet's Library. His allusion to the Cape Club in the poem named appears to have been the subject of humorous accusation against the poet. Hence, perhaps, the 'Summons'.\" Ford also notes that \"Precentor was the club-title of Fergusson\". (pg 202). Fergusson was a Scottish poet educated in St Andrews but who lived most of his life in Edinburgh. He wrote in both English and Scots.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Scotland</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Summons</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>f.3r</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Subset/Host Work</span>", "label": "Related Work Notes"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Fergusson, Robert</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Laing, David</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Holograph Manuscript</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Authors</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Eighteenth Century</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>103169044</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Summons, f.3r</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2010:02:05 16:08:47</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/La-II-334-3.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "La-II-334-3"}
