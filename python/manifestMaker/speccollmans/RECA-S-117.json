Primarily a poet, this is one of his works of prose that is not one of his sermons or other religious writings. This particular edition was printed 300 years after his death when his poetry began to gain some celebrity again, after falling out of fashion after his death with people like Samuel Johnson dismissing his works for being crude and uncouth. It wasn\u2019t until the early 20th century that modern poets began to regard his work with literary value again. The Nonesuch Press printed this edition in 1923, with two editions printed after Donne\u2019s death and \u2018with one additional PROBLEME\u2019. Their first publication as a company was also of Donne\u2019s works, a volume of his Love Poems. The Press was known for using a hand press to design their books and then had them printed by commercial printers in order to provide cheap versions for more people. This gives Paradoxes and Problemes the look it would have around the time when it was first being circulated. http://discovered.ed.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=44UOE_ALMA2197558730002466&indx=1&recIds=44UOE_ALMA2197558730002466&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&submit=Search&query=any%2Ccontains%2CRECA.S.117+&vl%288819882UI0%29=any&search_scope=default_scope&dscnt=0&scp.scps=scope%3A%2844UOE_DSPACE%29%2Cscope%3A%2844UOE_PURE%29%2Cscope%3A%2844UOE_ALMA%29%2Cprimo_central_multiple_fe&onCampus=false&vid=44UOE_VU1&institution=44UOE&bulkSize=10&highlight=true&tab=default_tab&dym=true&displayField=title&vl%28freeText0%29=RECA.S.117%20&dstmp=1453806370356</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Binding: publisher's decorated paper over boards, with letterpress title label on spine.</span>", "label": "Material"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Soho : The Nonesuch Press, 30 Gerrard Street</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Philosophy</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Paradoxes and Problemes</span>", "label": "Related Work Title"}, {"value": "<span>Title page</span>", "label": "Related Work Page No"}, {"value": "<span>Subset/Host Work</span>", "label": "Related Work Notes"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Inscription in ms. in ink, on upper right corner of flyleaf: \"H.J.C.
