Indulgences formed part of the process of penance in the late medieval church by granting the owner remission for the punishment for sin and would have normally been obtained for a fee. The sale of indulgences caused controversy especially at the beginning of the sixteenth century when Martin Luther attacked the practice of issuing indulgences in his 1495 Theses at the start of the Protestant Reformation. Copies of this same indulgence, unsigned and uncut, can be found preserved in UCL 4135. Print runs for indulgences were huge and often ran in the thousands, though very few of them survive as they were considered disposable documents. Printed indulgences were widely popular for those that issued them as the body of the text would remain largely the same from indulgence to indulgence, meaning that spaces could be left to fill in the information pertinent to the purchaser, eliminating the need to physically write a new indulgence for each customer. Wynken de Worde (born Jan van Wynkyn) was a printer and publisher who came to England in the late fifteenth century and is known for his work with William Caxton. After serving as Caxton's assistant, Wyken took over Caxton's death in 1492 and a three year litigation, in 1495 began running the shop on his own and instituted practices that resemble a modern method of production. De Worde shifted patronage to not only include the ruling elite, but also the commercial elite through mass production of popular works. Wyken de Worde has over 800 titles associated with his name. In late 1500 or early 1501 de Worde moved the shop from Westminster to Fleet Street in London, which for centuries after would be synonymous with printing. Wyken de Worde died in 1534 and is currently known as one of the most prolific early printers in England and is especially noted for his frequent use of woodcut illustrations in the texts that he produced.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Printed sheet</span>", "label": "Work Type"}, {"value": "<span>Paper</span>", "label": "Material"}, {"value": "<span>Printing</span>", "label": "Technique"}, {"value": "<span>Westminster</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Compostella</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Christianity</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>STC (2nd ed.) 14077c.85,</span>", "label": "Reference"}, {"value": "<span>ESTCS93204,</span>", "label": "Reference"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 2005 Edinburgh University Library</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>1497</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>15Th Century</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Early Printing</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Incunabula</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Papal Indulgence</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>William Caxton</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Wynken De Worde</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>138160744</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Wynkyn de Worde Papal Indulgence, Westminster, 1498, Recto</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2010:02:17 16:10:48</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/Inc-235.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "Inc-235"}
