Although this draft is very similar to the version published, there are some unique lines in stanza four of the draft that do not appear in the published version. Fergusson has noted below the title that the song's tune should be \"How happy a state does the miller possess\". Fergusson seems to have written up this draft of the poem as a letter, as he has signed the bottom of the page and included a note that reads \"Don't shew this to the knights as I would wish to surprise them with it\". \"Cape Song\" was not published in Fergusson's lifetime, appearing as a published poem for the first time in 1904 in Dr. Hans Hecht's introduction to _Songs from David Herd's Manuscripts_, William J. Hay, John Knox's House, Edinburgh. Fergusson was a Scottish poet educated in St Andrews and lived most of his life in Edinburgh. He wrote in both English and Scots.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Centre for Research Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Production Place"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>Correspondence</span>", "label": "Subject Category"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>Fergusson, Robert</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Archives</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Literature</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Authors</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Poetry</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Holograph Manuscript</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Eighteenth Century</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Scotland</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Correspondence and Journals</span>", "label": "Tag"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>100760336</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Cape Song, f.1r</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 The University of Edinburgh</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>2010:02:05 16:08:47</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://test.librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/manifests/La-II-334-1.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~63380~103802", "label": "La-II-334-1"}
