The model shows that crystals of rock salt or sodium chloride are small cubes. It is not known what apparatus Crum Brown used, but the model shows that he had realised the ionic nature of the structure, whereas most chemists at the time believed in a molecular structure.

He went on to an academic career that spanned the disciplines of English, history, archaeology, ethnology and geology. He was also a gifted artist - energetic and ambidextrous (seemingly so that he could work twice as fast to accomplish all that needed to be done). In 1848 he published 'Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time', an important study of old Edinburgh extensively illustrated with wood engravings after his own drawings and watercolours. The one shown here appears facing page 104 of volme II, and shows the house once occupied by the renowned printer Andrew Symson. Many other of Wilson's originals are in Edinburgh University Library. In 1853 Wilson moved to Canada to take up an appointment as Professor of English and History at the not-yet-constructed University College Toronto. Later he served as president both of University College and the University of Toronto. Although he was professor of English, Wilson was an important figure in the early history of archaeology. He of was one of the first to realise the implications of both Hutton's and Darwin's discoveries for the study of human history, and to describe this new area of study he coined the word 'prehistory'. In 1862, three years after Darwin published 'On the Origin of Species', Wilson produced his two-volume opus, 'Researches into the Origin of Civilisation in the Old and New World'.</span>", "label": "Description"}, {"value": "<span>Painting</span>", "label": "Work Type"}, {"value": "<span>Special Collections/Main Library</span>", "label": "Location"}, {"value": "<span>Object Lessons</span>", "label": "Repository"}, {"value": "<span>Cropped Tiff</span>", "label": "Repro File Type"}, {"value": "<span>75189128</span>", "label": "Repro File Size (bytes)"}, {"value": "<span>Wilson -</span>", "label": "Repro Title"}, {"value": "<span>Edinburgh University Library Photography Department</span>", "label": "Repro Creator Name"}, {"value": "<span>Object Lessons</span>", "label": "Repro Repository"}, {"value": "<span>ol0056</span>", "label": "Repro Old ID Number"}, {"value": "<span>\u00a9 Edinburgh University Library</span>", "label": "Repro Rights Statement"}, {"value": "<span>04/08/2003 12:32:00</span>", "label": "Repro Capture Date"}]}], "viewingHint": "individual", "@type": "sc:Sequence"}], "logo": "https://www.eemec.med.ed.ac.uk/img/logo-white.png", "@id": "https://librarylabs.ed.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/calendars/2006:_Object_Lessons.json", "@type": "sc:Manifest", "related": "https://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEgal~5~5~150311~162636", "label": "2006: Object Lessons"}
